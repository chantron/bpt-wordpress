# Brown Paper Tickets PHP API Wrapper
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/BrownPaperTickets/BptAPI.php.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/BrownPaperTickets/BptAPI.php)

The BptAPI library consists of a set of classes that enable you to easily interact with the [Brown Paper Tickets API](http://www.brownpapertickets.com/apidocs/index.html).

## Usage

After installing the library (either through composer or by dropping the files into your own project), you'll want to first initialize the class that contains the methods you want to use. Everytime you intialize a class, you need to pass in your Brown Paper Tickets Developer ID.

For Example, to get a listing of events under a specific account, you'd use the [EventInfo](#eventinfo) class.

```php
$devID = 'SomeDeveloperID'
$eventInfo = new EventInfo($devID);
```

That will give you access to all of that class' methods.

Most methods require a `$userName` argument. The `$userName` in all cases is the Brown Paper Tickets username of the event producer. Some methods take a couple arguments, some take an array of arguments if the
number of arguments is over four.

To obtain an array containing all of the producer's events, we'd invoke the `getEvents` method. The get events method takes a total of four arguments:

| Arguments | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| $userName | String  | No | The event producer whos events you wish to get |
| $eventID  | Integer | No | An Event ID if you want to get info on a particular Event |
| $getDates | Boolean | No | Pass `true` if you want to get a list of dates belonging to the event. Defaults to `false`|
| $getPrices| Boolean | No | Pass `true` if you want to get a list of prices belogning to each Date. Defaults to `false`|

```php
$events = $eventInfo->getEvents('some user name' null, true, true);
 ```
This would return an associative array with all of the event info along with dates and prices:

```php

        [shortDescription] => This is a short description.
        [fullDescription] => This is the full description. Much fuller! Lots more to say! OMG!

Use the Full Description to describe your event as completely as possible. It's common to list performers or presenters along with a short bio for each. Additional details, such as a description of the expected activities, help create interest for potential attendees and can greatly increase attendance. This is your chance to create a verbal picture of your event!
